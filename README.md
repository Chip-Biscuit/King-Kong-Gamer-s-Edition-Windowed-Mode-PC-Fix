# King-Kong-Gamerâ€™s-Edition-Windowed-Mode-PC-Fix

simply put the d3d9.dll and d3d9.ini into your game folder next to the game exe replace the origional files that are there with these and your good to go.

you can edit settings in d3d9.ini 

Default for FPS cap is 60 you can change it as you like or uncap with 0.

the only thing added to this is window mode functionality so you can turn window mode on or off in the d3d9.ini. to be clear it just adds window mode into 13AG's existing fixes for this game specifically Gamers Edition Version.

having the game in window mode fixes issues with alt tabbing.

go to SettingsApplication.exe to change your resolution for window mode - (1) for the window size, dont forget if you set it to (0) - fullscreen, to set it back to what you want your fullscreen resolution to be.
