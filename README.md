![kingkong](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4119a05c-5384-4a86-b444-b772e4cf50d3)

# Requirements before using fix
This fix should be used with https://github.com/ThirteenAG/WidescreenFixesPack/releases/tag/kingkong  The d3d9.dll and d3d9.ini files from the ThirteenAG fix should be replaced with the ones from the Fix Enhancers fix.

# Instructions
Go to the releases page and download the latest release of the KingKongGamersEditionFix.zip file. Then extract the d3d9.dll and d3d9.ini files into your game folder next to the KingKong.exe file and you are good to go! You can edit the settings you wish to use in the d3d9.ini file.

# Window Mode
The only addition to this fix is Window Mode functionality which will allow you to turn on Window Mode inside of the d3d9.ini file. The rest of the options are ThirteenAG’s existing fixes for the King Kong Gamer’s Edition version of the game specifically.

By having the game in window mode this will allow you to be able to use alt tab without any issues which are normally present in fullscreen.

To use the Window Mode, you must go to SettingsApplication.exe to change your resolution for window mode - (1) for the window size and don’t forget if you set it to (0) - fullscreen to make sure you set it back to what you want your fullscreen resolution to be.

# FPS
The default for FPS is (60) you can change it as you wish or fully uncap it with 0 with the FPSLimit option in the d3d9.ini file.
